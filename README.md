# xemanue's dotfiles

This is a collection of the configurations I use daily. They are only guaranteed to work in my machine, so I would **not** recommend installing them right away. Be cautious and use them as a reference instead.

## Usage

1. Clone this repo into your home directory.
2. `cd` into it.
3. Run `stow --dotfiles --no-folding` for the config folder you want to use. It will automatically get symlinked in the appropiate folder (usually .config)
