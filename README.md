# xemanue's dotfiles

This is a collection of the configurations I use. They are only guaranteed to work in my machine, so I would **not** recommend installing them mindlessly. Be free to use them as a reference.

## Usage
1. Clone this repo into your home directory.
2. `cd` into it.
3. Run `stow --dotfiles --no-folding` for the config folder you want to use. It will automatically get symlinked in the appropiate folder (usually .config)
